You are being asked to create a (Comparable) data class Student that will be used to maintain information for registration.

For this project, your class will contain the student’s firstName, lastName, IDNo.

Your class should include a constructor that will accept the student’s name and a 3-digit ID.

You should include the necessary accessors and mutators, equals, compareTo, toString.

equals will check the IDNo

compareTo will be used to alphabetize students by their names (last, then first if needed)

toString will return a “formatted” string for the student name and ID. (the format is up to you)
